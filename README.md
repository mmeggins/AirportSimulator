# AirportSimulator
This program simulates the time behavior of airplanes arriving at an airport and waiting to land, where airplanes arrive at random intervals with a limited quantity of fuel which determines their position in the holding pattern. Airlines with less fuel are given landing priority over airlines with more fuel and the airport can accept a landing every two minutes.
